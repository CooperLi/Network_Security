### nmap
1. Which is the option to dermine whether a host is online or not?
$ nmap -sP www.google.com

2. $ nmap -sT -O www.google.com
-sT: TCP Connect() 
-O: Operation system

3. $ nmap -sU -v www.google.com
-sU: UDP scan
-v: more details

4. $ nmap -sT -p 80 www.google.com
-p 80: scan port 80

5. $ nmap -sS -p 80 www.google.com
-sS (TCP SYN scan) .
           SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second
           on a fast network not hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never completes TCP
           connections. SYN scan works against any compliant TCP stack rather than depending on idiosyncrasies of specific platforms as Nmap's
           FIN/NULL/Xmas, Maimon and idle scans do. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states.

           This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you don't open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN packet, as if you
           are going to open a real connection and then wait for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is listening (open), while a RST (reset) is
           indicative of a non-listener. If no response is received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is also
           marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received. The port is also considered open if a SYN
           packet (without the ACK flag) is received in response. This can be due to an extremely rare TCP feature known as a simultaneous open or
           split handshake connection (see http://nmap.org/misc/split-handshake.pdf).
